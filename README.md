# Enhancing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Capabilities for Historical Documents

This repository contains my research work on **Enhancing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Capabilities for Historical Documents** during Students Pushing INnovation (SPIN) Internship Program @ The National Center for Supercomputing Applications with the permission from supervisor

 - **hallucinations.ipynb**: containing the process of understanding hallucinations from the result from trained the different post-correction models using different text similarities techniques
 - **inference.ipynb**: containing the process of creating predicted output from the different post-correction models and preform inferences
 - **new_just_word.ipynb**: contaiing the process of testing the optimal model on new dataset
